# Blog Content Revival Agent

**Built by [AI Ranking](https://skool.com/ai-ranking) — free to use and modify.**

This tool rewrites blog posts flagged as "Crawled - currently not indexed" in Google Search Console. It fetches your post, audits what's wrong, then rewrites it using the capsule content technique — structured for Google Featured Snippets and AI answer engines.

Each rewrite includes:
- Matched tone of voice to your original content
- Capsule content structure (question H2s with bold direct answers)
- Real external citations linked to credible sources
- Internal links pulled from your sitemap
- Minimum 1,200 words

## Option A: Use it instantly (no install)

👉 **[Open the tool here](https://your-app.streamlit.app)** ← *(replace with your Streamlit Cloud URL)*

You just need an Anthropic API key. The tool runs in your browser — nothing is installed on your computer.

---

## Option B: Run it locally

Running it locally means your rewrites stay on your machine, you can modify the prompts, and it works offline once set up.

### Step 1: Get Python

Check if you have it:
```
python3 --version
```

If you get an error, download Python from [python.org/downloads](https://python.org/downloads) and install it. Any version 3.10 or newer works.

### Step 2: Download this tool

Click the green **Code** button at the top of this page, then **Download ZIP**. Unzip it somewhere easy to find (like your Desktop).

Or if you use Git:
```
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/blog-revival-agent.git
```

### Step 3: Install dependencies

Open Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows), navigate to the folder, and run:

```
cd blog-revival-agent
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This installs everything the tool needs. You only do this once.

### Step 4: Launch the tool

```
streamlit run app.py
```

Your browser will open automatically at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Getting your Anthropic API key

The tool uses Claude AI to rewrite your posts. You pay Anthropic directly for what you use — typically **$0.02–0.05 per post**. There's no subscription.

1. Go to [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com)
2. Sign up or log in
3. Click **API Keys** in the left sidebar
4. Click **Create Key**, give it a name, copy it
5. Paste it into the tool when prompted

Your key is only stored in your browser session — it's never saved to disk or sent anywhere except Anthropic's API.

## How to use it

### Exporting from Google Search Console

1. Open [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
2. Click **Indexing** → **Pages** in the left sidebar
3. Click on **"Crawled - currently not indexed"** in the list
4. Click the **Export** button (top right) → **Download CSV**

That CSV is what you drop into the tool.

### Running a rewrite

1. Enter your website domain (e.g. `https://myblog.com`)
2. Upload your GSC CSV export, or paste URLs manually
3. Paste your Anthropic API key
4. Click **Run Analysis & Rewrite**

The tool will:
- Fetch each post
- Run a 2-pass Claude analysis (audit then rewrite)
- Show you a live cost counter as it runs
- Display the rewritten posts with a summary table
- Let you download everything as a ZIP

## Customising the tool

The prompts that control how Claude rewrites your content are in `rewriter.py`. Open it in any text editor (or VS Code) and look for `REWRITE_PROMPT` and `ANALYSIS_PROMPT`.

Common things people change:
- **Minimum word count** — find `Minimum 1,200 words` in the rewrite prompt and change the number
- **Tone instructions** — the tone section at the top of `REWRITE_PROMPT` can be adjusted
- **Number of internal links** — find `at least 3-5 internal links` and change the range
- **Target year for updates** — find `2024-2025 information` and update as needed

Save the file and reload the browser — changes take effect immediately.

## Troubleshooting

**"No sitemap found"**
Your sitemap needs to be at `/sitemap.xml` or declared in `robots.txt`. WordPress sites usually have one at `/wp-sitemap.xml`. If yours is somewhere else, paste the sitemap URL directly into the domain field.

**"Failed to fetch post"**
Some sites block automated requests. Try with a different post first to confirm the tool is working. Cloudflare-protected sites may block fetches.

**API key error**
Double-check the key at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) and make sure your account has a payment method added.

**Port already in use**
If `localhost:8501` throws an error, another Streamlit app is running. Either close it or run on a different port:
```
streamlit run app.py --server.port 8502
```
